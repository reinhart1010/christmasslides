## About these Slides

All slideshows contained in this repository are not made using Microsoft PowerPoint or similar presentation software. This is the reason why this repository do not have any common presentation files such as `.pptx`. Instead, these slides are built using common Web technologies and heavily based on [reveal.js] HTML presentation framework.

Using web technologies allows us to bring more features to slides, such as embedding online videos and maps. In addition, [reveal.js] slides are able to scale and adapt in different screen sizes, from mobile phones to large television displays. Some fonts are embedded into these slides, reducing the problem with missing fonts across different computers and operating systems. Lastly, a modern web browser is the only requirement to start the slideshow, hence compatibility issues across presentation softwares are no longer concerned.
